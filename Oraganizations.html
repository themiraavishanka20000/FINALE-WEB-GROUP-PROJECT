<section class="Sea"><div class="topic1"><h2>Marine Environment Protection Authority(MEPA)</h2></div>

<div class="p1"><p>Under the requirements of the Marine Pollution Prevention (MPP) Act No. 59 of 1981, the Marine Pollution Prevention Authority (MPPA) was 
founded in 1991. Until 1994, it was under the control of the Ministry of Ports and Shipping. The Marine Pollution Control Act No. 35 of 2008, 
which takes into account the growing issues in marine pollution prevention in Sri Lanka as a result of worldwide advancements and increased 
economic development activities, abolished the Act. The Authority's name was changed to the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) on 
January 1, 2009, and it now falls under the Ministry of Urban Development, Coast Conservation, Waste Disposal, and Community Cleanliness 
jurisdiction. The Authority's law enforcement capacities have been improved as a result of this act, allowing it to deal with any act of marine 
environment contamination more effectively and efficiently.</p>

<section class="Wild"><div class="topic3"><h2>The Wildlife & Nature Protection Society</h2></div>

<div class="p3"><p>The Wildlife and Nature Protection Society of Sri Lanka has a long and illustrious history in Sri Lankan wildlife conservation. The WNPS,
which is 126 years old, is the world's third oldest non-governmental organization and is responsible for the establishment of Sri Lanka's 
Wilpattu and Yala National Parks, as well as the Department of Wildlife Conservation. One of the world's 34 biodiversity hotspots in Sri Lanka. 
It's also one of the top ten countries most impacted by global warming. Droughts and floods, among other extreme weather occurrences, enhance 
competition for resources, growing human activities threaten the existence of many species, and rapidly disappearing natural habitats continue to 
have devastating implications in their natural environment.</p>
