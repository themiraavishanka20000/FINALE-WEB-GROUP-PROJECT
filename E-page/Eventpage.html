 				<h1>Building a Road to a Better Future</h1>
 				<p>An ecosystem is a location where all living things coexist. Unfortunately, pollution and other factors are causing a major section of the ecosystem to deteriorate. It is our responsibility to keep the environment in good shape.Our natural surroundings are where we receive our air, food, and water. In a nutshell, the environment supplies us with everything we need and is the foundation of our existence on this planet. Saving the environment is a habit that we may incorporate into our daily lives in order to sustain the quality of life here. Natural resources are in short supply, therefore environmental activists are urging people to conserve them.Many steps have been taken to protect the environment </p>
